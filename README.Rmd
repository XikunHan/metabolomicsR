## Getting started

[The detailed tutorial](https://xikunhan.github.io/metabolomicsR/docs/articles/Introduction.html). 

<strong>metabolomicsR</strong> is a streamlined R package to preprocess, analyze, and visualize metabolomic data. We included a set of functions for sample and metabolite quality control, outlier detection, missing value imputation, dimensional reduction, normalization, data integration, regression analysis, annotation, enrichment analysis, and visualization of data and results. The <strong>metabolomicsR</strong> is designed to be a comprehensive R package that can be easily used by researchers with basic R programming skills. The framework designed here is also versatile and is extensible to various methods and metabolomic platforms.
