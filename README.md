### `{metabolomicsR}` Tools to process, analyze, and visualize metabolomic data.

`{metabolomicsR}` is a streamlined R package to preprocess, analyze, and
visualize metabolomics data. We included broad utility functions for
sample and metabolite quality control, outlier detection, missing value
imputation, dimensional reduction, normalization, data integration,
regression, metabolite annotation, enrichment analysis, and
visualization of data and results. The `{metabolomicsR}` is designed to
be a comprehensive R package that can be easily used by researchers with
basic R programming skills. The framework designed here is versatile and
is extensible to other various methods. Here, we demonstrate the
step-by-step use of the main functions from this package.
